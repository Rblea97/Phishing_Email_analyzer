# Detection Rules Documentation

This document provides detailed information about the 9 weighted detection rules used in the AI-Powered Phishing Detection System.

## üéØ Rule Engine Overview

The rule-based detection engine uses 9 weighted rules that analyze different aspects of email authenticity and suspicious patterns. Each rule contributes a weighted score (0-20 points) to the overall risk assessment.

**Total Possible Score**: 95 points  
**Classification Thresholds**:
- **0-20**: Likely Safe
- **21-50**: Suspicious  
- **51+**: Likely Phishing

## üîç Detection Rules Details

### 1. Header Mismatch Detection (Weight: 15)

**Rule ID**: `HEADER_MISMATCH`  
**Description**: Detects when the display name domain differs from the actual sender domain  
**Risk Level**: High (authentication spoofing)

#### How It Works
```python
display_name = "PayPal Security"
from_domain = "suspicious-phishing-site.com"
# Mismatch detected: PayPal mentioned but sent from different domain
```

#### Examples
- ‚úÖ **Triggers**: "Apple Support" `<scam@fake-apple.com>`
- ‚úÖ **Triggers**: "Microsoft Security" `<noreply@microsoft-security.net>`  
- ‚ùå **Safe**: "John Smith" `<john@company.com>` (no brand spoofing)

#### Real Detection
```
From: PayPal Security <notifications@secure-verification.top>
Display: PayPal | Domain: secure-verification.top
Evidence: Display name suggests "PayPal" but domain is suspicious TLD
```

### 2. Reply-To Mismatch (Weight: 10)

**Rule ID**: `REPLYTO_MISMATCH`  
**Description**: Identifies emails where Reply-To domain differs from From domain  
**Risk Level**: Medium (response redirection)

#### How It Works
```python
from_domain = "company.com"
reply_to_domain = "different-collector.com"
# Potential response harvesting attempt
```

#### Examples
- ‚úÖ **Triggers**: From `service@bank.com`, Reply-To `harvest@data-collector.net`
- ‚ùå **Safe**: From `noreply@company.com`, Reply-To `support@company.com`

#### Real Detection
```
From: notifications@fake-service123.com
Reply-To: support@different-domain.net  
Evidence: Reply-To redirects responses to different organization
```

---

### 3. Authentication Failures (Weight: 20)

**Rule ID**: `AUTH_FAILURES`  
**Description**: Detects SPF, DKIM, and DMARC authentication failures

#### How It Works
```python
spf_keywords = ["fail", "softfail", "none", "neutral"]
dmarc_keywords = ["fail", "none"] 
dkim_keywords = ["fail", "invalid", "none"]
```

#### Examples
- ‚úÖ **Triggers**: `Authentication-Results: spf=fail`
- ‚úÖ **Triggers**: `DMARC: fail (p=reject)`
- ‚ùå **Safe**: `SPF: pass, DKIM: pass, DMARC: pass`

#### Real Detection
```
Authentication-Results: gmail.com; spf=fail smtp.mailfrom=fake-domain.com;
dmarc=fail (p=reject dis=none) header.from=spoofed-bank.com
Evidence: Multiple authentication failures indicate spoofing attempt
```

]
```

#### Examples
- ‚úÖ **Triggers**: "Your account expires today - verify immediately!"
