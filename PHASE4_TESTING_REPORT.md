## üîß Issues Identified & Resolved

### 1. ‚úÖ Missing Database Schema (RESOLVED)
**Issue:** Flask app couldn't start due to missing base database tables  
**Resolution:** Created `create_base_schema.py` to establish foundational tables  
**Impact:** Critical - prevented application startup  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed in commit `ec1c950`

### 2. ‚úÖ WeasyPrint Import Error (RESOLVED)  
**Issue:** Windows GTK libraries missing causing WeasyPrint import failure  
**Resolution:** Enhanced error handling to gracefully fall back to ReportLab  
**Impact:** Low - fallback PDF generation working correctly  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed in commit `ec1c950`

### 3. ‚úÖ Database Path Mismatch (RESOLVED)
**Issue:** Flask app looking for `phishing_detector.db` but database was `data/phishing_analyzer.db`  
**Resolution:** Created `.env` file with correct `DATABASE_PATH` configuration  
**Impact:** Critical - prevented database access  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed during testing session

### 4. ‚úÖ DateTime Serialization Error (RESOLVED)
**Issue:** JSON serialization failing on datetime objects in URL analysis  
**Resolution:** Added datetime-to-string converter before JSON serialization  
**Impact:** Medium - URL analysis results not being stored  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed in commit `c6af7d5`
