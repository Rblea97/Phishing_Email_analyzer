## üìù Demo Script Template

Use this narration script:

"This is an AI-powered phishing detection system that combines rule-based analysis with GPT-4o-mini artificial intelligence. 

[Upload file] Let's analyze a suspicious corporate email. The system processes the email through both detection engines.

[Show results] Our rule-based engine identifies multiple threat indicators including authentication failures and urgency tactics, giving this email a high risk score.

[AI tab] The AI analysis provides additional context, identifying subtle social engineering patterns that rules might miss.

[History] The system maintains a complete audit trail, making it perfect for security teams and training purposes.

This demonstrates how advanced AI can enhance traditional cybersecurity tools for better threat detection."
